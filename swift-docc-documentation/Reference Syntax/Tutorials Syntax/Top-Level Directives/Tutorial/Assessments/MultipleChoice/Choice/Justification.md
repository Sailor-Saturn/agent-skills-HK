- Parameters:
    - reaction: Text that clearly and succinctly indicates whether the answer is correct or incorrect, for example "Correct!" or "Sorry, try again." **(required)**

## Overview

Use the `Justification` directive to display a response when the reader chooses an answer in a multiple-choice assessment question in a tutorial. Use the `reaction` parameter to briefly indicate whether the choice is correct or incorrect. Then, provide some more descriptive text that explains why. In the case of an incorrect answer, consider also providing a hint so the reader can try again.
