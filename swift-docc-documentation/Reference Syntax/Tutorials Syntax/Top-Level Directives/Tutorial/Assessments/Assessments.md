# `docc.Assessments`

Tests the reader's knowledge at the end of a tutorial page.

## Overview

Use the `Assessment` directive to display an assessments section that helps the reader check their knowledge of your Swift framework or package APIs at the end of a tutorial page. An assessment includes a set of multiple-choice questions that you create using the `MultipleChoice` directive. If the reader gets a question wrong, you can provide a hint that points them toward the correct answer so they can try again.
