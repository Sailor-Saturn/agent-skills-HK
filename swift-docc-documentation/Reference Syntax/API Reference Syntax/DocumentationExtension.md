# `DocumentationExtension`

Defines whether the content in a documentation extension file replaces in-source documentation or amends it (the default).

- Parameters:
    - mergeBehavior: A value of `override` to replace the in-source documentation with the extension file's content. **(required)**

## Overview

By default, content from the documentation-extension file is added after the content from the in-source documentation for that symbol.

Swift framework and package APIs are typically documented using comments that reside in-source, alongside the APIs themselves. In some cases, you may wish to supplement or replace in-source documentation with content from dedicated documentation extension files. To learn about this process, see [Adding Supplemental Content to a Documentation Catalog](../adding-supplemental-content-to-a-documentation-catalog.md).

Place the `DocumentationExtension` directive within a `Metadata` directive in a documentation extension file. Set the `mergeBehavior` parameter to `append` or `override` to indicate whether the extension file's content amends or replaces the in-source documentation.

```
```

> **Note:** > You can specify a `append` merge behavior but it has the same effect as not defining a `@DocumentationExtension` and results in a warning.
